Amplify - All of our calls to action on your phone!

We all want to be in the habit of doing the weekly indivisible4c actions. But it's hard to do if we're each acting alone. Join us on the Amplify mobile app built by Indivisible SF. We update it each week with our list of actions, and you can view call scripts and call members of congress right from the app. You can also see the stream of actions taken by other members, and press the “cheer” button to cheer them on. Please accept notifications, they will only go out Sunday evenings (when the calls to action are updated) and in occasional "emergency" situations.

Get set up:

1. Install the Amplify app for iPhone or Android (look for the American flag).

2. Create a new account.

3. Enter the indivisible4c code : 118-350-982.

4. Take and action and cheer others on!
