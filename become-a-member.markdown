Political Advocacy in the Suburbs?

Yes, we are proud to be a part of indivisible4c (Central Contra Costa County). Located 10 miles east of Oakland, we include the cities of Pleasant Hill, Martinez, Concord, Walnut Creek, Clayton, Lafayette, and more. While some of us have been involved in advocacy for years, many members of indivisible4c are first-time activists. We love our country and want to protect our democracy. Members of indivisible4c share the desire to do whatever we can to fight the Trump agenda. Our strength is in our passion and our numbers.

While our mission is to beat the Trump administration, we do much more than call our Members of Congress. See Action Teams for more information

**New members are always welcome.**
