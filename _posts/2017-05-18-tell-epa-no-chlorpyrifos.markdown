Background:
The EPA is proposing to overturn regulations that ban toxic chemical chlorpyrifos, which are used in pesticides (Lorsban). Chlorpyrifos belongs to a class of pesticides called organophosphates, a diverse group of compounds that includes nerve agents like sarin gas. Chlorpyrifos moves to all parts of the body after exposure. Chlorpyrifos itself is not toxic, but when the body tries to break it down, it creates a toxic form. This toxic form, called chlorpyrifos oxon, binds permanently to enzymes which control the messages that travel between nerve cells. When chlorpyrifos binds to too many of the enzymes, nerves and muscles do not function correctly. The body then must make more enzymes so that normal nerve function can resume. The body can break down and excrete most of the unbound chlorpyrifos in feces and urine within a few days. Chlorpyrifos that finds its way into the nervous system may stay there much longer.The NYTimes report, [A Strong Case Against Pesticide Does Not Faze EPA Under Trump](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/health/pesticides-epa-chlorpyrifos-scott-pruitt.html), highlights the danger of chlorpyrifos, "Decades of research into the effects of chlorpyrifos strongly suggests that exposure at even low levels may threaten children. A few years ago, scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that it should be banned altogether."


Federal agencies are required to take comments from the public. You can file a comment on the proposed order by the Administrator  denying the “Petition to Revoke All Tolerances and Cancel All Registrations for the Pesticide Chlorpyrifos” (comments due by June 5th).
