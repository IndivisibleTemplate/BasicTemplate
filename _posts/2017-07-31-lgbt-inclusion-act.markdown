  calling to find out why the congressman is not a cosponsor of HR 3273, the LGBT
  Data Inclusion Act? This bill would help ensure that policy makers have the information
  they need to serve the communities they represent. Is the congressman planning to
  cosponsor the bill?\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nCongressmen Swalwell, Garamendi and Congresswomen
  Lee and Speier, along with 82 other members of the house have already cosigned.
  I will be disappointed if our representative does not feel this legislation is important,
  and I'd like your office to let me know his decision as soon as possible. \n<br>\n<br>\n(give
  them your email)"

H.R. 3273, The LGBT Inclusion Act, would require federal surveys to include data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity. While some federal data on LGBT communities is currently collected, there is no centralized requirement prioritizing the collection of LGBT data in federal surveys which the LGBT Data Inclusion Act addresses.

Currently, 86 members of the house have co-signed the bill. Two names are not on that list, Congressman DeSaulnier and Congressman Thompson. Please give your rep a call and ask him to co-sign the bill.
