The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, aka Trumpcare, has been released. What do we know?

"The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America." ~President Obama, June 22nd.

It is not a health bill, it is a tax cut.
The results will be devastating, people will die.

It's important to be able to discuss this issue using facts. Take some time to review the information so that you can tell the people you know why they should call their Senators today.

## What you need to know to talk about the bill

The basics, [NPR's Chart: Who Wins, Who Loses With the Senate Health Care Bill](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/22/533942041/who-wins-who-loses-with-senate-health-care-bill)
<br>

While Republicans argue the Senate bill is better because it doesn't allow insurance companies to deny patients for pre-existing conditions, that's a deceptive statement. To understand, read The Atlantic's [How the Senate's Health-Care Bill Would Cause Financial Ruin for People With Preexisting Conditions](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/ahca-senate-bill-preexisting-conditions/531375/). If Essential Health Benefits are not required, anyone with a pre-existing condition should be worried.

Who is opposed to the bill? It's not just the Democrats in Congress. [President Obama's Facebook Post](https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10154996557026749) explains, "It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it." It's also the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-health-reform-vision), [American Association of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/SenateHealthCareBill.aspx), [American Cancer Society](https://www.acscan.org/releases/patients-would-pay-more-less-coverage-under-senate-health-bill), [American Lung Association](http://www.lung.org/about-us/media/press-releases/ALA-Urges-Senate-to-Oppose-Healthcare-Bill.html?referrer=http://www.businessinsider.com/senate-republican-health-care-plan-slammed-by-doctors-and-patient-advocates-2017-6), [American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/06/better-care-reconciliation.aspx), and so many more. The AARP wrote an article titled, ["Senate Unveils Health Bill - and It's Bad"](http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/senate-health-care-bill.html?intcmp=AE-HP-FLXSLDR-SLIDE1). This is a small sample of groups that have expressed opposition, in fact, it is difficult to find anyone outside of a fraction of Congress and the White House that support the bill.

As of 6/25, the vote is scheduled for Thursday, June 29th. Currently there are enough republican senators expressing doubt to assume it won't pass, but don't be fooled. We said this before. This was expected, McConnell may be heartless, but he is no fool. Great explanation in this article from Slate, [We Know How This Ends](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/06/trumpcare_is_right_where_republicans_want_it.html).

What can we do?
* Call our Senators and ask them to withhold consent and filibuster by amendment.

* Call "moderate" Senators and ask them to vote no. While we don't live in their states, we spend money there. Let them know if they take away our insurance, we take away our dollars. ~It is important to be honest, please do not lie about where you live.~
