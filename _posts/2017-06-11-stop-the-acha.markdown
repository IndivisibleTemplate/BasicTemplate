"The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America." ~President Obama, June 22nd.

It is not a health bill, it is a tax cut.
The results will be devastating, people will die.![td.png](/uploads/td.png)


It's important to be able to discuss this issue using facts. Take some time to review the information so that you can tell the people you know why they should call their Senators today.

## What you need to know to talk about the bill

The CBO score is in. You can [read the 50 page report](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52849-hr1628senate.pdf) or the [CBO summary](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52849). WaPo's article [CBO: Senate GOP health-care bill would leave 22 million more people uninsured by 2026](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/imminent-cbo-report-could-prove-pivotal-for-senate-republicans-health-care-bill/2017/06/26/cb8d61e2-59f7-11e7-a9f6-7c3296387341_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_cbosenate-12pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.7cfb9059ddd1) provides a clear overview of the report.

While Republicans argue the Senate bill is better because it doesn't allow insurance companies to deny patients for pre-existing conditions, that's a deceptive statement. To understand, read The Atlantic's [How the Senate's Health-Care Bill Would Cause Financial Ruin for People With Preexisting Conditions](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/ahca-senate-bill-preexisting-conditions/531375/). If Essential Health Benefits are not required, anyone with a pre-existing condition should be worried.

Who is opposed to the bill? It's not just the Democrats in Congress. [President Obama's Facebook Post](https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10154996557026749) explains, "It would raise costs, reduce coverage, roll back protections, and ruin Medicaid as we know it." It's also the [American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-health-reform-vision), [American Association of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/SenateHealthCareBill.aspx), [American Cancer Society](https://www.acscan.org/releases/patients-would-pay-more-less-coverage-under-senate-health-bill), [American Lung Association](http://www.lung.org/about-us/media/press-releases/ALA-Urges-Senate-to-Oppose-Healthcare-Bill.html?referrer=http://www.businessinsider.com/senate-republican-health-care-plan-slammed-by-doctors-and-patient-advocates-2017-6), [American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/06/better-care-reconciliation.aspx), and so many more. The AARP wrote an article titled, ["Senate Unveils Health Bill - and It's Bad"](http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/senate-health-care-bill.html?intcmp=AE-HP-FLXSLDR-SLIDE1). This is a small sample of groups that have expressed opposition, in fact, it is difficult to find anyone outside of a fraction of Congress and the White House that support the bill.

## Why You Should Be Worried
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday that he would cut the chamber’s August recess in half, saying the GOP needed more time to achieve its legislative goals given the protracted negotiations over health-care legislation and continued opposition from Democrats on several fronts. He has scheduled a pivotal meeting Thursday for all Republican senators to discuss the party's beleaguered effort to repeal Obamacare.

The conference, which remains deeply divided on the health bill, will meet at 11:30 am. on Thursday in the Capitol.

What can we do?
* Call our Senators and ask them to withhold consent and filibuster by amendment.

* Call "moderate" Senators and ask them to vote no. While we don't live in their states, we spend money there. Let them know if they take away our insurance, we take away our dollars. ~It is important to be honest, please do not lie about where you live.~

The bad news? The strategies being utilized [by the democrats have limits](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/06/19/senate-leaders-plan-to-rush-a-health-care-bill-to-a-vote-and-theres-nothing-democrats-can-do-about-it/?utm_term=.a1ebe7b43eb7). It may not pass this week, but if it's postponed (or even voted down) expect to see it rise from the dead before August break. The Republicans ran campaigns based on repealing Obamacare, and many feel they will lose their seats if they don't [accomplish that goal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/replacing-obamacare-is-a-make-or-break-moment-for-republicans/2017/06/25/c5f7775a-59c9-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html?utm_term=.d7ccc275d528).That doesn't mean you should give up, but we need to be realistic, only the republicans can stop this bill. [Senate Republicans want to get to yes on the health care bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/06/23/daily-202-senate-republicans-want-to-get-to-yes-on-the-health-care-bill/594c147de9b69b2fb981de1e/?utm_term=.640bbfb6d6b4).

### In moments like this we need to remember the quote that was critical in the creation of indivisible4c, written by Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel, "There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest."
