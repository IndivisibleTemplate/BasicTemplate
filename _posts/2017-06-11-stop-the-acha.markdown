Remember how we all said not to worry about the House Trumpcare bill because the Senate would never pass it? We were wrong.

What can we do?
* Call our Senators and ask them to withhold consent and filibuster by amendment.

* Call "moderate" Senators and ask them to vote no. While we don't live in their states, we spend money there. Let them know if they take away our insurance, we take away our dollars.
