call-script-text: My name is X, my zip code is X, and I am a member of Indivisible
  Central Contra Costa County. I am calling to urge Senator X to vote no on the so-called
  “regulatory reform” bills, which would prevent the federal agencies from passing
  regulations that protect my health, safety and welfare. Please ask Senator X to
  reject these dangerous and irresponsible bills. Thank you.

A set of bills regarding regulations have passed in the house, cleared Senate committees, and will be up to vote on the Senate floor within the week. Dubbed “regulatory reform” by the gop, these bills would effectively paralyze the EPA and other federal agencies from passing regulations to protect our health, safety and welfare. These bills are supported by Koch Industries and other large corporations. If passed by the Senate, they will have a significant, and negative, impact on our lives. The bills include:
<br>
* S34 The Midnight Rules Relief Act: Allows congress to strike down multiple regulations with one vote.
* S951 The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA): This is being pitched as a bipartisan bill, but in reality it makes the regulation process so difficult that it is likely to result in a significant drop in the regulations that protect our air, water, and workplace.
* S21 Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act: Essentially gives Congress more power to reject regulations. Federal agencies would be required to seek approval before issuing major rules.
* S584 The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act: Requires agencies to assess potential direct and indirect impacts of regulations on small businesses (EPA, OSHA, and CFPB), undermining the implementation of health and safety rules mandated by law.
<br>
These bills have all passed in the house, a senate vote will put them on Trump’s desk! All of these laws would prevent basic protections of water, food, consumer items, workplace safety, and more, and they will all benefit large corporations.
