A group of local constituents working on SB54 have spent over a month trying to schedule a meeting with Assemblyman Grayson. He has literally ignored their requests, and his field director's (Michael Sponsler) excuse is that he's very busy. His Sacramento director, Nina, has also been avoiding phone calls and emails requesting a meeting.

Grayson has voted against the democrats in a number of key votes. He voted against bail reform (AB 42), and was one one of only three members of the assembly to vote no on CA Buy Clean Act. He refuses to meet with constituents, has very few public events, and seems to be disconnected to the people who put him in office.
