SB54, The California Values Act, was written to protect the safety and well-being of all Californians by ensuring that state and local resources are not used to fuel mass deportations, separate families, or divide
Californians on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, immigration
status, or national or ethnic origins.
