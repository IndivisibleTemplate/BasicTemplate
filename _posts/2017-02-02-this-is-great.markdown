  Hi, my name is _________ and I'm one of Senator [Harris/Feinstein]'s constituents. My zip code is ______.

  I'm also a member of Indivisible SF. We are San Francisco residents who oppose Trump's agenda.

  I'm calling to ask the Senator to vote no on Scott Pruitt’s nomination for the EPA. I am concerned about the harm to California's environment if he were to limit our ability to regulate greenhouse gases and auto emissions. A person who doesn't agree that human activity is the primary cause of global warming isn't someone I want in charge of the EPA.

**Specific Asks**

* Oppose Steven Bannon
* Prevent a Trump Supreme Court nominee
* No on Sessions (Feinstein still hasn’t committed!)
