  I am calling to thank Senator Feinstein/Harris for requesting an independent investigation into the ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. I'd like for her to show her commitment by agreeing to withhold consent for all Senate business until a special prosecutor has been appointed. She represents the voters of California, and we expect her to do everything in her power to protect our democracy. Please let Senator Feinstein/Harris her know that I'll be watching carefully to see if she listens to her constituents by objecting to all Unanimous Consent requests until an independent prosecutor has been appointed.

  **Remember, the script is fine, but natural conversation is best.

(info from the Indivisible Guide)

Call and email both Senators every day until a special prosecutor has been appointed!

### WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.

On May 9th, Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Director Comey was in the process of leading the investigation into Russian interference in last year’s presidential elections, including possible connections to the Trump campaign. We’ll repeat that: Donald Trump fired the man charged with investigating his Administration. This is a big, flashing, red alarm sign for our democracy.

This isn’t about partisan politics. This is about the defending our most basic democratic institutions and values. Your Members of Congress (MoCs) need to decide whether they’re on the side of truth, or on the side of Trump.

You can read the Indivisible Guide information about ["Truth or Trump"](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/truth-or-trump/) which includes background, evidence of connections to Russian, info about types of investigations and why they selected this call to action.

### YOUR ROLE: WHAT YOU CAN ASK YOUR SENATORS TO ACTUALLY DO ABOUT THIS

Slow the Senate to a crawl until we get a special prosecutor. Congress should not be conducting business as usual when our democracy is under direct threat. It is every Member of Congress’ sworn duty to protect and defend our country, including from abuses of power by the sitting President. And, we have some leverage in the Senate, where any individual Senator has the power to slow and even shut down legislative business. That gives them a lot of power, and they should be using it.

Demand that your two Senators stop the Senate from conducting business until a special prosecutor is appointed. Tell them to object on every motion and filibuster every piece of legislation. This will effectively slow the Senate to a crawl, making it difficult to carry on business as usual. For a refresher on withholding consent and filibustering, see our explainer.

Eventually, Trump will attempt to appoint a replacement FBI Director. If no special prosecutor is in place before Trump nominates a new FBI Director, your Senator should refuse to confirm a Trump crony until one is appointed. If just three Republicans choose to stand up for truth instead of for Trump, we can block any nominee until he appoints the special prosecutor.

You should make this call and send an email once a day until an independent (and acceptable) special prosecutor has been appointed.
