Hundreds of mayors across the United States have committed to upholding the goals of the Paris Climate agreement. Unfortunately, mayors in CCC have not been eager to sign the agreement.

The Contra Costa County Climate Leaders (4CL) is working to encourage city councils in CCC to join the 364 mayors that have already signed the pledge. 

Martinez, Richmond, and El Cerrito are the only cities in CCC that have agreed to sign the pledge. While some cities appear to be open to the idea, other cities, such as Walnut Creek, have refused to even put it on their agenda.

We will add Calls to Action for specific cities as needed.
