* Attend one or both meetings to show your support; Tuesday May 2nd 6:00 at the Concord

Background
There is an attempt for five schools (Northgate High, Foothill Middle, Bancroft Elementary,
Valle Verde Elementary, and Walnut Acres Elementary) to splinter from the MDUSD to form a
new district.The "Northgate Community Advocacy for our Public Schools (CAPS)" claims that
their intent is to bring local control of education to their community. While true, there are
consequences when wealthier portions of a community split off from the larger district. Does it
benefit the kids in the new district? Maybe. Does it hurt the other kids in the district? Absolutely.
Educational Gerrymandering is not new, parents all over the country are fighting to redraw the
boundaries of school districts in a way that will benefit their wealthier (and less diverse)
neighborhoods. Yet the research is clear, this comes at a huge expense to those children living
outside of these borders.
