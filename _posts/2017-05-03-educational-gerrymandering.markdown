Mark Your Calendar! The Contra Costa County Board of Education (County Committee on School District Organization) Hearing will be held on Tuesday, August 29th at 4:00 p.m. in the Pleasant Hill Middle School Multi-Use Room: 1 Santa Barbara Road, Pleasant Hill 94523.

Background
There is an attempt for five schools (Northgate High, Foothill Middle, Bancroft Elementary,
Valle Verde Elementary, and Walnut Acres Elementary) to splinter from the MDUSD to form a
new district.The "Northgate Community Advocacy for our Public Schools (CAPS)" claims that
their intent is to bring local control of education to their community. While true, there are
consequences when wealthier portions of a community split off from the larger district. Does it
benefit the kids in the new district? Maybe. Does it hurt the other kids in the district? Absolutely.

<br>
Educational Gerrymandering is not new, parents all over the country are fighting to redraw the
boundaries of school districts in a way that will benefit their wealthier (and less diverse)
neighborhoods. Yet the research is clear, this comes at a huge expense to those children living
outside of these borders. It's not a coincidence that the research used by the group attempting to leave the district was funded by the Koch brothers and other right-wing groups. Segregation is alive and well in some parts of the United States, let's make sure we don't let it happen in our community.
