It’s called the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017 (RAA), and it’s an extremely dangerous bill that the Senate will soon vote on. Introduced by Senators Portman (R-OH) and Heitkamp (D-ND), the bill changes long-standing rules on how federal agencies regulate everything from food safety to toxic chemicals to equipment failure at nuclear power plants—things that keep us all safe. The RAA would prioritize corporate profits over public protections and paralyze the regulatory process, making it even harder for the government to protect the public.

This bill has passed in the House, the only thing keeping it off Trump's desk is the Senate, call today!
