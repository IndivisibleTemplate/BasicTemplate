From the League of Conservation Voters:

The Department of the Interior is accepting public comments about the public protected lands review until July 10, 2017. We have set a goal of 100,000 comments by the end of the public comment period so Trump and Zinke see that THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. Being President doesnâ€™t give him the right to try and eliminate or shrink any national monuments or parks.

[Public lands belong in public hands!]
