On June 8, 1906, Congress approved the Antiquities Act, which authorized the president to designate federally managed lands as national monuments to conserve important historic, scientific and archaeological sites. After more than a century of success, the Antiquities Act and some of the monuments created using the law are in danger. An executive order by President Trump has mandated a review of 27 national monuments designated since 1996. That review could result in recommendations to rescind the designations in their entirety or significantly alter the monuments.
 
As part of that process, the public is being invited to weigh in on the review as a whole via written comments or an online portal. The White House is calling it the “first ever formal public comment period for members of the public to officially weigh in on monument designations under the Antiquities Act of 1906,” which of course ignores the years-long process of proposals, legislative efforts, and public comments that went into the vast majority of these monuments.
 
Bears Ears National Monument is a 1.3-million-acre conservation area that was designated by President Barack Obama in his final days in office. President Trump had called for a review of that decision, and Mr. Zinke’s recommendation is being watched closely as an indicator of how the Trump administration will treat public lands.
 
Last week, Mr. Zinke made his recommendation in a report, Bears Ears monument designation was “not the best use of the land.” Mr. Zinke recommended that Mr. Trump roll back the boundaries to protect only areas that include historic and prehistoric structures, such as archaeological sites and remains of dwellings. Mr. Zinke declined to quantify the exact area of the proposed smaller monument, but said that the new boundaries should be limited to “the smallest area compatible” with the management of those sites.

In California, six national monuments are threatened:
* The San Gabriel Mountains monument, which forms a backdrop to Los Angeles.
* The Mojave Trails and Sand to Snow monuments in the Southern California desert.
* The Giant Sequoia monument in the southern Sierra Nevada.
* The Carrizo Plain monument on the southwestern edge of the San Joaquin Valley.
* The Berryessa Snow Mountain in Northern California.
