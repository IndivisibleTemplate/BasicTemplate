[Example Link](http://example.com) Today's Daily Action is to call your senators to reiterate that Andy Puzder is a terrible--and now even more vulnerable--choice for Secretary of Labor. Yesterday, Puzder and the parent company of his Carl's Jr. fast-food chain were hit with a class action lawsuit for wage suppression.

If you're keeping track, Puzder is also under fire for previous comments admitting that 40% of his employees were undocumented and for personally employing an undocumented worker as his maid for years - and only paying taxes for this worker after he was nominated to the Cabinet. All of these actions are, of course, violations of the laws our Labor Department is supposed to enforce. (A normal President would have long since forced such a nominee to withdraw, but Trump assumes that if he can push Betsy DeVos through, he can do anything.)

With Puzder's Senate confirmation hearing scheduled for next Thursday, it seems his only real qualification for this job was the $300,000 he gave to Donald Trump and the Republican Party in last year's election So tell your Senators we need to see a few more resumes for this position because Andy's record is just a little too raggedy. Let's aim for a Labor Secretary with experience defending our labor laws - not breaking them.
