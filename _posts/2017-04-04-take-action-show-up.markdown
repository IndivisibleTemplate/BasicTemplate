  For Senators only!

  Hello, my name is __, my zip code is __, and I am a member of indivisible4c. Please tell the senator that I am disappointed that she does not feel it is important to meet with her constituents. She needs to plan a town hall meeting.

**Our senators have no town hall meetings planned, that isn't acceptable. Call, let them know that we expect them to do their job.

Nothing is more powerful than face-to-face contact with your members of congress. Attend as many town hall meetings as possible. Ask questions. Share opinions.

* April 8: Joint town hall with Thompson and McNerney

* April 11: DeSaulnier town hall in Richmond

* April 12: DeSaulnier town hall in Lafayette
