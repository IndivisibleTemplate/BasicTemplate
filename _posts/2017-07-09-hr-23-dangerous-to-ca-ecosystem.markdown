call-script-text: 'Hi, my name is x, my zip code is x, and I am a member of indivisible
  4c.I have recently learned that HR 23, the GROW act, might be voted on soon. Does
  Congressman DeSaulnier plan to oppose this legislation? (if yes, thank you -- If
  no answer or maybe keep going!) I am concerned that this bill will significantly
  hurt CA''s ecosystem. It exempts projects of the CVP and SWP from the federal endangered
  species act. It would allow the fed gov''t to override CA laws and regulations to
  protect our delta. Please let Congressman DeSaulnier know that I am opposed to this
  bill and would like him to vote no. Thank you. '

H.R. 23, co-sponsored by a group of California San Joaquin Valley Republican members of Congress led by David Valadao (R-Hanford), is formally titled the “Gaining Responsibility on Water Act of 2017.” While is has been laying low, suddenly it has resurfaced and could have a full house vote this week.  125 pages in length, the bill seeks to make numerous changes to the way the federally-constructed and administered Central Valley Project (CVP) operates to deliver water throughout California’s Central Valley.

By easing environmental flow restrictions, it will "cut red tape" in order to build dams, tunnels, and other systems. It would even prevent state water regulators from imposing any restrictions on new projects.

Let's make sure this doesn't slide under the radar, call Rep DeSaulnier and ask if he is committed to voting no on HR23!
