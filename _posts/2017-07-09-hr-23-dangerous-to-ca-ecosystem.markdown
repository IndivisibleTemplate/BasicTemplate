  Hi, my name is x, my zip code is x, and I am a member of indivisible 4c.

  I am very concerned about HR 23, the Gaining Responsibility of Water Act. This bill could permanently harm our rivers and the Bay-Delta estuary. It will override CA environmental law and prevent implementation of the Endangered Species Act. Please tell the Congressman that I am alarmed at recent legislation to speed this bill to a floor vote and that I strongly oppose this dangerous legislation.

  Thank you.

Tell Congressman DeSaulnier or Congressman Thompson to oppose HR 23!

~~Update: HR 23 is now being brought to a vote under the same rules as the military appropriations bill. This will limit debate.

Letters opposing the bill:
[Governor Brown](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/media-uploads/hr_23_governor_brown_oppose.pdf),

[Senators Feinstein and Harris](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=1E243FC5-4351-409F-BF12-3B0C8A4ED9D8AG),

H.R. 23, co-sponsored by a group of California San Joaquin Valley Republican members of Congress led by David Valadao (R-Hanford), is formally titled the “Gaining Responsibility on Water Act of 2017.” While is has been laying low, suddenly it has resurfaced and could have a full house vote this week.  125 pages in length, the bill seeks to make numerous changes to the way the federally-constructed and administered Central Valley Project (CVP) operates to deliver water throughout California’s Central Valley.

By easing environmental flow restrictions, it will "cut red tape" in order to build dams, tunnels, and other systems. It would even prevent state water regulators from imposing any restrictions on new projects.

Let's make sure this doesn't slide under the radar, call Rep DeSaulnier or Rep Thompson and tell him you oppose HR 23!
